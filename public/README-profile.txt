Place your profile photo here so the site can display it in the Hero section.

Steps:
1. Save the image you attached to this project as `profile.jpg`.
2. Put the file into the project's `public` folder: `public/profile.jpg`.
3. Restart the dev server (if running): `npm run dev`.

Notes:
- The Hero component reads the image from the public root at `/profile.jpg`.
- If you'd like a different filename, update `personalInfo.profileImage` in `src/constants/index.js` to match the path.
